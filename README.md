 Python ARP Spoofer Tool

Description:
The Python ARP Spoofer tool is a powerful utility designed to aid in network security testing and analysis. Using Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing techniques, this tool allows users to manipulate network traffic and redirect it through their own machine, providing an avenue for monitoring, analyzing, and potentially altering network communications.

Key Features:

ARP Spoofing: The tool utilizes ARP spoofing to deceive devices on a local network, tricking them into associating the attacker's MAC address with a specific IP address. This enables the interception and manipulation of network traffic.
Traffic Redirection: Once the ARP spoofing is initiated, the tool can redirect network traffic between two targeted devices through the attacker's machine, allowing for the inspection and analysis of the data packets being transmitted.
Network Monitoring: With the ability to intercept and redirect traffic, the tool facilitates network monitoring by capturing packets, analyzing their contents, and providing insights into network behavior, potential vulnerabilities, or security weaknesses.
MITM Attacks: The tool enables Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks by intercepting and modifying network traffic, allowing for the injection of malicious payloads, capturing sensitive information, or conducting further attacks.
User-Friendly Interface: The tool provides a user-friendly interface, making it accessible for both experienced network security professionals and beginners interested in learning about network security and testing.
Important Note:
It's crucial to use this tool responsibly and within the boundaries of legal and ethical considerations. Unauthorized use of this tool on networks without proper authorization is strictly prohibited and may have serious legal consequences. The tool should only be used for educational purposes, network security assessments, or other lawful and authorized activities.
